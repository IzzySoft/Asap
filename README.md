# Amazons Product Advertising API for PHP

This is a collection of PHP classes to enable you to access the Amazons Product
Advertising API easily from within PHP – with the goal of placing some ads on
your site, so they generate you some money to make up for all the hard work you
put into building and maintaining it, whenever a visitor clicks an ad and buys
something at Amazon.

In case you wonder about the name: *AsAP* stands for *Amazon simple Api for PHP*


## Requirements

* Amazon accounts: AWS, PartnerNet
* an associate ID you can generate at the PartnerNet site
* a pair of public/private key you can create at the AWS site
* PHP with curl support (e.g. PHP5 with `php5-curl` on Debian)
* some coding knowledge: this is an API, i.e. an Application Programmers
  Interface – not a ready-to-use application


## Credits

Multiple developers have been working on this API. The corresponding information
you can find

* in aforementioned API Reference
* in the PHP files
* behind the links in both places

I'm just one in this line, building upon the base work done by the others. So
major credits belong to my "forefathers". For their original work, let me refer
you to

* [CodeDiesel Blog Article on it](http://www.codediesel.com/php/accessing-amazon-product-advertising-api-in-php/)  
  This is where the original scripts came from.
* [Wern-Ancheta Blog](http://wern-ancheta.com/blog/2013/02/10/getting-started-with-amazon-product-advertising-api/)  
  On this article I based my changes to the original classes.
